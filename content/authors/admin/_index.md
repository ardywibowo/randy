I am a 1st year PhD student in the Biomedical & Genomic Signal Processing (GSP) Lab in Texas A&M University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I am working with Professor Xiaoning Qian. My current interests are in time series data analysis, prediction, control, and intervention using graphical models.



In time series modeling, I aim to develop interpretable models through structure learning/temporal clustering. I am interested in modeling dynamic systems more precisely through non-Markovian transition dynamics. In control and intervention, I aim to develop more personalized and reliable health intervention strategies through behavioral modeling by borrowing ideas from game theory and robust optimization.

Awesome posts are tagged awesome. Stay tuned :).
