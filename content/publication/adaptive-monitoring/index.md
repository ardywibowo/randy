abstract: 'In many machine learning tasks, input features with varying degrees
  of predictive capability are usually acquired at some cost. For example, in
  human activity recognition (HAR) and mobile health (mHealth) applications,
  monitoring performance should be achieved with a low cost to gather different
  sensory features, as maintaining sensors incur monetary, computation, and
  energy cost. We propose an adaptive feature selection method that dynamically
  selects features for prediction at any given time point. We formulate this
  problem as an  minimization problem across time, and cast the combinatorial
  optimization problem into a stochastic optimization formulation. We then
  utilize a differentiable relaxation to make the problem amenable to
  gradient-based optimization. Our evaluations on four activity recognition
  datasets show that our method achieves a favorable trade-off between
  performance and the number of features used. Moreover, the dynamically
  selected features of our approach are shown to be interpretable and associated
  with the actual activity types.slides: ""'
