abstract: "Emerging wearable and environmental sensor technologies provide
  health professionals with unprecedented capacity to continuously collect human
  behavior data for health monitoring and management. This enables new solutions
  to mitigate globally emerging health problems such as obesity. With such
  outburst of dynamic sensor data, it is critical that appropriate mathematical
  models and computational analytic methods are developed to translate the
  collected data into an accurate characterization of the underlying health
  dynamics, enabling more reliable personalized monitoring, prediction, and
  intervention of health status changes. However, several challenges arise in
  translating them effectively into personalized activity plans. Besides common
  analytic challenges that come from the missing values and outliers often seen
  in sensor behavior data, modeling the complex health dynamics with potential
  influence from human daily behaviors also pose significant challenges. We
  address these challenges as follows: We firstly explore existing missing value
  imputation and outlier detection preprocessing methods. We compare these
  methods with a recently developed dynamic system learning method – SSMO – that
  learns a personalized behavior model from real-world sensor data while
  simultaneously estimating missing values and detecting outliers. We then focus
  on modeling heterogeneous dynamics to better capture health status changes
  under different conditions, which may lead to more effective state-dependent
  intervention strategies. We implement switching-state dynamic models with
  different complexity levels on real-world daily behavior data. Finally, we
  conducted evaluation experiments of these models to demonstrate the importance
  of modeling the dynamic heterogeneity, as well as simultaneously conducting
  missing value imputation and outlier detection in achieving better prediction
  of health status changes."
